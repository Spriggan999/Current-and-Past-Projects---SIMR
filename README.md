# Current-and-Past-Projects---SIMR
# Some of my current and past work.
#

# Sentiment Analysis was one of my first projects after learning Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence almost two years ago.
# Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease from voice samples and investigating how similar languages could be used to train a model was my first big project.
# Classifying some images in different datasets such as MNIST was a small project I completed with a CNN as I was learning how to create and code CNNs and DCNNS.
# My current work involves optimizing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (or U-Net) by model depth (3, 4, or 5) and by color space (RGB, LAB, YCbCr) of the image of the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation for subjects with traumatic brain injuries.
